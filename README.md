# Leet Code Question Answers & Reviews

This repository contains my LeetCode problem reviews, including my attempted solutions, notes about approach and reasoning, and the final/correct answers with explanations. The goal is to track progress, document thought processes, and provide clear, reusable solutions to common LeetCode problems.

## What you'll find here

- Problem folders or files organized by LeetCode problem ID and name (e.g., `0001-two-sum`).
- Each problem entry includes:
  - A short problem summary.
  - My initial attempt(s) and thought process.
  - The final/correct solution with explanation, complexity analysis, and any edge cases handled.
  - If applicable, multiple language implementations (Python, Java, C++, etc.).

## Example entry structure

```
0001-two-sum/
  README.md        # problem description, notes, time/space complexity
  solution.py       # my final python solution
  attempt1.py       # earlier attempt (kept for learning)
  discussion.md     # reasoning, pitfalls, alternative approaches
```

## How to use

- Browse by problem folder to read notes and solutions.
- Use code files directly to run and test solutions locally.
- Search the repository for a topic (e.g., "two pointers", "binary search") to find related problems.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you'd like to add a solution or improve an existing write-up:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add your problem folder or update an existing one following the example structure.
3. Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

Please include: problem id/name, language, and why the change improves the entry (fixes bug, improves complexity, clarifies explanation).

## Notes on correctness

Solutions are documented with explanations and complexity analysis. If you find an incorrect solution or edge case not handled, please open an issue or submit a PR with a fix and test cases.

## License

This repository is for learning and reference. Include your chosen license file if you wish to allow reuse (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.).

Happy coding! Keep solutions focused on clarity and correctness rather than cleverness alone.
